# Rice Leaf Disease Classification Using CNN

This project develops a classification model for rice leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model can identify four types of rice leaf diseases from images: Bacterial Blight, Blast, Brown Spot, and Tungro.
The model is designed to assist in the early detection and classification of rice leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. By accurately identifying these diseases, farmers and agricultural professionals can take appropriate actions to manage and control the spread of diseases, thereby improving crop yield and quality.

## Rice Leaf Diseases

1. **Bacterial Blight**: A disease caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas oryzae*, leading to yellowing and wilting of leaves, and significant yield loss.
2. **Blast**: Caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae*, this disease results in lesions on leaves, collars, nodes, and panicles, severely affecting the plant's growth.
3. **Brown Spot**: Triggered by the fungus *Bipolaris oryzae*, this disease manifests as brown lesions on the leaves, which can reduce the photosynthetic area and weaken the plant.
4. **Tungro**: A viral disease transmitted by leafhoppers, characterized by stunted growth and yellow-orange discoloration of the leaves, leading to severe yield loss.

## Methods

- **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Using a CNN to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy and loss.
